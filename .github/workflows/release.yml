# Notes for production releases:
#
# Android Signing:
# - Add secrets: ANDROID_KEYSTORE (base64), KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, KEY_ALIAS, KEY_PASSWORD
# - Configure signing in android-app/build.gradle.kts
# - Update workflow to decode keystore before building
#
# macOS Code Signing (optional but recommended):
# - Add Apple Developer certificate secrets
# - Configure signing to avoid security warnings for users
